# Mauve

Mauve is a bot that does a few things related to roles.

1: By using the command m;index it spits out a list of every user with one of the 12 targeted roles, with a numbers summary appended.

2: By using the command m;replace it replaces all of the 12 targeted roles with their designated replacements

The bot also has a permissions role named "MauvePermissions" which is necessary to run all commands outside of m;ping
