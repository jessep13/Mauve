# Mauve

Mauve is a two trick pony. 
By running the command m;index the bot generates a list of every user with the target roles

By running the command m;replace it replaces the target roles with the replacement roles (once implemented)

At it's current state Mauve is currently set to replace a single user's roles when pinged, like this: m;replace @user

The bot also has a permissions role named "MauvePermissions" which is necessary to run all commands outside of m;ping

Please open a pull request if you make changes to this <3
